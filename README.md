glsl-mode
=========

Emacs major mode for editing OpenGL shader files.

Written using a guide and the reference documents for GLSL found online. This
mode attempts to be 'complete'; however, as I am not the best GLSL programmer
around (I would classify myself more of a GLSL newbie) it is highly likely that
I missed stuff or classified something wrong.

Preprocessor statements, types, keywords, attributes and constants are all highlighted to the best of my knowledge. There are issues with tabbing specifically
after statements like 'layout(packed)', and function definitions don't get
colored.
